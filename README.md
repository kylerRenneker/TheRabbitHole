# The Rabbit Hole <a href="https://kylerrenneker.github.io/TheRabbitHole/">Live</a>
Find semi-random youtube videos either based on all available categories of youtube videos, from one of a select few categories, or a user input search term.
## Motivation
We wanted to randomize the youtube experience of the average user. If you don't have a specific idea as to what it is you want to watch, the random button can help. If you just want to watch popular music videos, there's a category for that. If you want to watch an obnoxious amount of youtube without having to actively look, we've solved that for you.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Features
Multiple sources from which to pull random video content from YouTube.

## Code Example
This is our function that randomizes the videos that are returned from the api call and rendered for the user.
<pre><code>
function getRandomId(responseJson) 
    { console.log(responseJson); 
    let randomItem = responseJson.items[Math.floor(Math.random() * responseJson.items.length)]; 
        if(responseJson.kind === 'youtube#searchListResponse'){ 
            id.newId = randomItem.id.videoId; 
        } else { id.newId = randomItem.id; } 
    renderVideoHtml(); }
</code></pre>



## API Reference
We're using google's YouTube api. The reference documentation for the endpoint used for the dropdown menu category based search can be found: <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list">Videos Endpoint</a>.


The documentation for the endpoint that is used for the user input search can be found here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list">Search Endpoint</a>.

## Challenges We Encountered
There were some challenges in utilizing the videos endpoint for music content. We eventually came to the realization that YouTube's music content will only be able to be fetched and played on a deployed site.

## How to use?
All a user needs to do is access the live-version of our site which can be found here: <a href="https://kylerrenneker.github.io/TheRabbitHole/">Live</a>, and utilize either the dropdown menu or the search bar to direct their search.
