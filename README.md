# The Rabbit Hole <a href="https://kylerrenneker.github.io/TheRabbitHole/">Live</a>
Find semi-random youtube videos either based on all available categories of youtube videos, from one of a select few categories, or a user input search term.
## Motivation
We wanted to randomize the youtube experience of the average user. If you don't have a specific idea as to what it is you want to watch, the random button can help. If you just want to watch popular music videos, there's a category for that. If you want to watch an obnoxious amount of youtube without having to actively look, we've solved that for you.

Include logo/demo screenshot etc.
